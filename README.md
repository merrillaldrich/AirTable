# AirTable
Physics engine tutorial

This little project came out of my son's desire to learn programming, first Javascript 
and now C#, and his interest in the simulation engines used in games. I thought I would 
try making a mechanics simulator just for fun, and to "record" all the steps I went through
as branches, so he can get the idea of how to move from a simple solution of a small problem
through more and more complex iterations. (He tends to want to take on the entire world
all at once, but as my neighbor used to say, if you want to eat a whole watermelon, best 
do it one bite at a time.)

This program progesses from simple one-dimensional motion to one-dimensional collisions,
to two dimensional collisions with stationary walls, to 2d collisions of moving objects.
Each step is stored in it's own numbered branch, if you want to follow along through that
process.

It's called AirTable because the simple physics involved are a bit like an air hockey table -
low friction, elastic collisions, round objects. It makes the math manageable, and I am certainly
no mathematician.

If you are into computer graphics the obvious question may be "why no matrix math" in this
tutorial, as I understand in real applications that's a much faster and more common model.
This one uses basic algebra and trig for clarity - I frankly can barely manage matrices, and
find it hard to understand what is going on mathematically when using matrix operations.
Since this is mainly just for my entertainment and a little tutorial for my son, I stuck to
plain algebra/trig.
